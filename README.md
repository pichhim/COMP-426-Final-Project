# About #
chat-tea is a social messaging application (with integrated tic-tac-toe) created as a final project for COMP 426: Modern Web Programming at UNC Chapel Hill. The main features of the site include:
- Creation of user accounts with an editable profile
- Being able to add/remove friends
- Real-time messaging and tic-tac-toe gaming

The tech stack used to build chat-tea consists of React on the frontend, with Firebase on the backend for user authentication and database usage.
